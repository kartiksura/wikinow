# wikinow

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kartiksura/wikinow/master/wikinow.png)

Implements a solution for wiki-racer problem.
# Aim:
1. Horizontally scalable (add nodes to scale-up)
2. Fault tolerant (killing nodes should not affect other tasks/data)
3. Performance
4. Simplicity
5. REST APIs

## Design philosophy:
For simplicity and performance, the central idea is: Avoid mapping Wikipedia, but store all the previously traversed data for future use.
We store the results and also the sub results which can be used for future use.


Whenever a new request is initiated by the user, a Job is created. 
A job has the following:
1. Source wiki title
2. Destination wiki title
3. Timeout in seconds

This job is pushed to the Redis list, which we use as a simple Pub-Sub.
The dispatcher continuously monitors the list for new jobs, and spawns a goroutine.
The goroutine then gets the titles associated with the current job and creates new jobs for fan-out.
The sub-results are also cached for future use.

### Job status control:
Each job as a Request ID. The fanout jobs also has the same request ID.
E.g.  
- Mike Tyson -> New York, Path: nil (ReqID 123) spawns 2 jobs:
- SXSW -> NewYork, Path: [Mike Tyson] (ReqID 123)
- Pro Boxing -> New York, Path:[Mike Tyson] (ReqID 123)

Whenever the Job is picked up, the status of the request ID is checked in redis:
1. If the timeout expired
2. If the job is already solved by another goroutine

This method of state communication helps in horizontally scaling and also efficiently controling the exponential fan-out.



## Techniques used:
1. Concurrency control by using buffered channel
2. Exponential back-off for polling the redis list

Further enhancements in future:
1. Using redis Pub-sub instead of list
2. Sharding the List for reducing the contention

The user gets a RequestID which can be used to get the status of the job. 

## API Spec
### Creating a job:
http://localhost:8080/request?src=Mike%20Tyson&dst=Heavyweight&timeOut=50

The output is a  json object containing the requestID:
{"ID":"15069b34-23c7-42a0-ad32-22a36fccdece"}


### Job status:
http://localhost:8080/solution?id=15069b34-23c7-42a0-ad32-22a36fccdece

The output is a json object containing the status of the JOB:
{
	"ID": "15069b34-23c7-42a0-ad32-22a36fccdece",
	"Status": "SOLVED_FROM_CACHE",
	"Path": ["Mike Tyson", "South by Southwest", "The Daily Mirror", "Heavyweight"],
	"ProcessingTime": "5.0327ms"
}

The Path field contains the path from Source to Destination


## TODO:
- Unit test cases.
- Stats monitoring.
- Dockerisation.
- vendoring

## Installation instructions
1. Install Redis and point the wikinow.conf to the instance e.g. :6379 for local instance
2. clone the repo
3. install the dependencies
4. go build
4. run the binary (./wikinow) 

## Note: 
Used the struct definitions from an opensource golang wiki media repo for parsing the API output.
